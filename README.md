this Python Script can be used for bounding box's size analyzation.

It transform the .xml files in Annotations, which is dataset type of RCNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, to DataFrame type of Pandas and build the histogram of length and height.

From the analyzation of bounding box's size dstribution histogram, it maybe usefully to parameters adjusting in RCNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN.
